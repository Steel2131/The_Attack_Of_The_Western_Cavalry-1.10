The imp got angry, and cut his hatchet into a horse's neck. The cut was so heavy that it partly cut off the horse's head. The suffering animal threw his rider off, jerked for a few moments, then collapsed and stopped moving; the horse was dead.

The attack was so sudden to the rider that he could not ready any; he fell so miserably that he broke his spine and died immediately."

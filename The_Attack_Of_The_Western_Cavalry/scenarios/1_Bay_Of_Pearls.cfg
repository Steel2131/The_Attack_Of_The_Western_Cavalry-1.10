This introduction contains some information about things which are different from the 'normal' game.

This campaign is difficult for beginners. The maps have lots of turns and twists, and it is unlikely that a strategy of 'kill every enemy' will succeed. There are also some subtle, silent changes that you won't notice unless you are very observant. Moreover, there are many foreign units involved, f.e. the Fighter unit from Heir to the Throne, and the AI prefers to recruit such units, so you will face different warfare than in the normal game.
Of course, you will be informed about every new/other feature during the gameplay.

On the next few pages, you can find a short help text about portable items.

Feedback is always thanked!

The maps show items that you can pick up. For this version, they can only increase some atrributes of the current unit, but later, they may have additional attrubutes (e.g, poisons). These items can be weapons, armor, potions, or special items."

You will know everything that is required to know about the western traditions. Though, here is a little summary of it, so if you want to know the aswers for many things earlier, you can. :)

In days of yore, far to the West and further away, well beyond the Green Isle and the Wesfolk Land, somewhere in an unknown land, Chiftain Xanthos I, obtained a very powerful weapon, called the Lance of the Death. The weapon proved to be undefeatable, and Xanthos I established a large realm. The country was the Western Empire.
Xanthos I was quite a normal tyrant. Although it was he who founded the beginnings of the later terror, he was just, and more or less rightous with his people.

But later it seemed that the Lance had a curse on it. Xanthos's attempts failed in sequence, including his own death, when he was murdered by his only son, Xanthos II.

It was this second tyrant who brought the darkest age the people of this planet had ever seen. By abusing the power of the Lance, it was impossible to stop him.

Thus, all the rebellions against him failed. The captured survivors did not stand a chance. It is impossible to tell the means of their executions in the common language, because there are no words for them. We can only describe it. It is similar to necromancy, because later they were recalled as Swamp Walkers, but the real technique cannot be defined.

The few refugees, who succeeded to avoid captivity, had only one chance - to flee forever their homeland. And they did so - they pirated some ships, and sailed to the far east, beyond the known frontiers...

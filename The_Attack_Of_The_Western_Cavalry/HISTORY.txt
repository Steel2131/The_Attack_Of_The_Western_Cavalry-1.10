Fixed fatal bugs:
- map4
- map7,7

For better reference, new maps need to be fitted into the storyline, maps' sequence needed to be rewritten

___________________________________

IMPORTANT!
Since this is not a battle, but a long campaign, the game will probably be renamed to 'The Invasion of the Western Cavalry".
Unfortunately there is no way to rename it on the server, and this way the forum will also stay the same, but:
- In the game it with 1.1.3 it is already 'invasion' everywhere
- The title description stays with 'invasion'
- The title still remains, it's not decided yet whether it'll change or not.

Map 13c corrected, morals are now counted properly. Although, finding of more fair way of counting is recommended!
Game don't crash before map 11 - up until that, there are no bugs anymore.
- No more unknown units (fully solved)
- LEADING_ANIM fully solved

Units have to be gone over when finished campaign - there are unneccessary units, taking seveleral precious bytes!

Solved unit image problems, also some wrong profiles were changed.
Noticed an old problem: some unit's descriptions are in hungarian, THESE NEED TO BE TRANSLATED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!



______________________________________

Bug fixing started 26.Febr.2012
- Solved [remove_item]
- Solved AMLA TOUGH
- Unknown units' appearance crashes the game, brought about at will by commenting wrong macroed units out. (partly solved)
- LEADING_ANIM temporarily solved, game in theory runs without crashing, but is buggy --> game development can be continued.

Early ugly solutions should be rewritten as soon as possible.

New map editor services should be used after all bugs are fixed.

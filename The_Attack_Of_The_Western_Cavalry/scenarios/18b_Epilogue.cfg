- Warwick, although he lost his remaining leg, lived.
- Arya, her sister, Flymcla, and Prince Henrik lived in the forests as rulers.
- Leogwyn was the first to die. He got into the middle of the arrow shower. After all the arrows fell, he was seen no more during the fight. His skull (detached from his spine, decorated with 4 wide holes) was later found.
- Garak was slain by a Wesnothian soldier. They fought for long, but Garak was tired, and was defeated - he dropped his sword. No need to tell, what happened after that. His corpse was later found.
- Morgan was heavily injured, and fell, but other corpses fell onto him, so he was never found after the battle. He probably died, but we can't know for certain.
- Lawrence was slain by a Guard who was attacking Weldyn. It took only a few moments.
- Xanthos II fled to the north. We don't know wheter he survived or not, but no tales were told about him later."
